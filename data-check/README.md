Data Check Project
Overview
This project is a Python-based exercise focused on writing clean, testable code. The primary objective is to develop a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. The project includes handling specific edge cases, such as ensuring the function returns 0 when a negative radius is provided.

Technologies Used
Python 3

pytest

Git & GitHub

Linux Terminal

Development Workflow
The entire development, testing, and deployment process was executed directly through the Linux terminal. Below is a summary of the key terminal operations performed during this project.

1. Code Editing
The built-in Nano text editor was used to write and modify the Python script directly within the terminal environment (using nano demo.py).

2. Running Unit Tests
The project relies on pytest to validate the logic. Tests were executed frequently in the terminal (pytest) to ensure the mathematical formula was correct and that the negative radius edge case was properly handled.

3. Version Control
After successfully passing all tests, the local directory was initialized as a Git repository, disconnected from its original cloned source, and pushed to a newly created centralized monorepo on GitHub using standard Git commands (git init, git add, git commit, git push).
